                <h2>What is Sickle Cell Anemia?</h2>
                <p>Sickle cell anemia is one of a group of inherited disorders known as sickle cell disease. It affects the shape of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of the body.<br>

Red blood cells are usually round and flexible, so they move easily through blood vessels. In sickle cell anemia, some red blood cells are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These sickle cells also become rigid and sticky, which can slow or block blood flow.

There's no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia. Treatments can relieve pain and help prevent complications associated with the disease.</p>

                <h2>History of Sickle Cell:</h2>
                <p >Sickle cell disease was first discovered in the early 1900s, described as "peculiar, elongated sickle-shaped erythrocytes [red blood cells]." With further study, a noted pathologist later suggested that the pain experienced by sickle cell patients resulted from the blockage of tiny blood vessels. In a landmark 1949 study, Dr. Linus Pauling concluded that sickle cell disease is caused by abnormal hemoglobin, referred to as "hemoglobin S." The disease was among the first to be understood fully at the biochemical level, as researchers learned that the abnormal hemoglobin was actually changing shape (called "sickling") due to a single amino acid error in hemoglobin S.

Even though the underlying molecular cause of the disease was understood more than half a century ago, progress in translating this knowledge into improved patient care has been slow. This partly reflects the intrinsic difficulty of treating the disease. However, it also results from the fact that, in the United States, sickle cell disease occurred in an underserved population for which health research and treatment were neglected. It was not until the civil rights movement of the early 1970s that the poor treatment of these patients was recognized as a prime example of racial inequality in health-care. In response, the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America was founded and later helped establish the Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act of 1972, which allotted government health funds for screening, research, and treatment programs.</p>

                <p>As scientific progress and technology improved, new treatment regimens evolved for sickle cell disease patients. The Prophylactic Penicillin Study (PROPS) found that giving penicillin, an antibiotic, when patients were not sick could prevent death related to serious infections in sickle cell disease. Later, the Multicenter Bone Marrow Transplant Study demonstrated that 84 percent of children with sickle cell disease who received a bone marrow transplant from a matched relative could be cured. Finally, in the mid-1990s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new therapy called hydroxyurea as a treatment to decrease complications of the disease. Hydroxyurea works in part by stimulating the body to resume production of fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F), a normal hemoglobin in the fetus that prevents sickling.</p>

                <h2>Sickle Cell Disease Symptoms:</h2>
                <p>Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear around 6 months of age. They vary from person to person and may change over time. Signs and symptoms can include:

<br><br><strong>Anemia:</strong> Sickle cells break apart easily and die. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells typically die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, the body can't get enough oxygen and this causes fatigue.
<br><br><strong>Episodes of pain:</strong> Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints.

The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few days. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay.

Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes.

<br><br><strong>Swelling of hands and feet:</strong> The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood circulation in the hands and feet.
<br><br><strong>Frequent infections:</strong> Sickle cells can damage the spleen, increasing vulnerability to infections. Infants and children with sickle cell anemia commonly receive vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia.
<br><br><strong>Delayed growth or puberty:</strong> Red blood cells provide the body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers.
<br><br><strong>Vision problems:</strong> Tiny blood vessels that supply the eyes can become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina — the portion of the eye that processes visual images — and lead to vision problems.</p>

             <h2>Causes:</h2>
                <p >Causes
Sickle cell anemia is caused by a change in the gene that tells the body to make the iron-rich compound in red blood cells called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen from the lungs throughout the body. The hemoglobin associated with sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen.<br><br>

For a child to be affected, both mother and father must carry one copy of the sickle cell gene — also known as sickle cell trait — and pass both copies of the altered form to the child.<br><br>

If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one typical hemoglobin gene and one altered form of the gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both typical hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin.<br><br>

Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don't have symptoms. They're carriers of the disease, however, which means they can pass the gene to their children.</p>
